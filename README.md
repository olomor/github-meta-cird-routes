# github-meta-cird-routes

This shell script will configure specific "ip routes" for github.com service. 

Usable when you are at HomeOffice connected over a enterprise vpn, that's generally is "blocked", so with this you may bypass the vpn routes/acls by defining specific routes throught your home network router.

:) Gotcha!
